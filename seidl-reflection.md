# GPS Release 7: Reflection

__What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?__
I was still trying to figure out what all the basic commands (like add, commit, push, fetch, and merge) really did and the best practices of when to stage, track, and commit, and push. I know these concepts will seem extremely simple as I continue to utilize them.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I definitely gained more confidence when I was driving and was able to recall the basic commands and understand what I was telling the computer to do. I have a better understanding of how to clone a repo, how to navigate and make changes to my local cloned repo, and what the different 'stages' of the changes that have been made to the local repo mean (add, commit, push).

__What questions did you ask your pair & the guide?__
About the fetch and merge commands, the different changes they make to the local repo, and why all of the branches were not showing up on a local repo after giving those commands. How to properly resolve a merge conflict and what we should expect to happen when working within a team (like the dev would normally resolve the conflict and then submit pull request).

**What still confuses you about Git?**
There's a lot that still confuses me, as there are many commands that I have not researched enough to ask questions. I will have to play with the commands that I have already been exposed to and hopefully things will continue to click and make sense. I think I understand some of the more commands, but need to get more experience with cloning and updating a local repo after giving fetch and merge commands.

__How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?__
I am happy that I was able to do individual pairing sessions before the GPS, as it allowed me to test out different things and set the stage for the GPS without much issue as the group had some exposure to working with one another. I am happy with the session; I think that we were able to work well together and helped us dig into things that we didn't understand and may not have thought about while working on our own.
