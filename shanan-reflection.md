**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was getting acquainted with Git before the GPS session, and I still am.  It took me some trial and error to understand when to make commits, how to name the commits, and how to make pull requests.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
What happens when you make a commit - tracking changes, not saving new version all the time, you commit changes, not files.  Also, I got more comfortable with the difference between local and shared repos.  I started reading about remotes and how the local and shared repos talk to one another.


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Why would you need to commit again after fetching and merging new changes?
Why does the local repo have some, but not all the branches as the shared repo?

**What still confuses you about Git?**
There is a lot to know about Git!  I would really like to learn a little but more about how branches and remotes operate, and how Git and GitHub work together. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was great!  It is really helpful to have feedback from fellow students and the guide.  Starting to understand the driver/navigator roles and how they work.  Also it was fun exploring and testing ideas with other people.
